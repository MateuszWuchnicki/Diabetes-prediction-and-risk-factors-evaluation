# Diabetes-prediction-and-risk-factors-evaluation
Supervised classification with the use of many machine learning models, including: Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree Classifier or Random Forest Classifier and others, in order to binary classification of healthy and diabetic people. Analysis based on a random sample of US adult respondents.

### Selected Subset of Features from BRFSS 2019

Given main risk factors, I tried to select features (columns/questions) in the BRFSS related to risk factors for diabetes. To help understand what the columns mean, I consult the BRFSS 2019 Codebook to see the questions and information about the questions. I try to match the variable names in the codebook to the variable names in the dataset. I also reference some of the same features chosen for a research paper by Zidian Xie et al for Building Risk Prediction Models for Type 2 Diabetes Using Machine Learning Techniques using data from the 2014 BRFSS.

### Purpose

The main purpose of this code notebook is to answer the question:

* **Can survey questions from the BRFSS provide accurate predictions of whether an individual has diabetes?**
